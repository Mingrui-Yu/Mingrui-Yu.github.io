## Adaptive traffic signal control with Deep reinforcement learning 
* 07/2018 - 06/2019
* Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences
* Advisor: Prof. Yisheng Lv

Contents:
* Proposed a DRL algorithm that automatically learns an optimal policy to adaptively determine
phase duration.
* Proposed a phase sensitive neural network structure based on DDPG model.
* Developed some interesting training techniques.

## Image processing in color+depth based 3D vision systems
* 02/2018 - 11/2018
* Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University
* Advisor: Prof. Meng Yang

Contents:
* Depth-based stereoscopic image zooming.
* Extension and application of Depth No-Synthesis-Error model for view synthesis in 3D video.
* Color guided depth map restoration for synthesized view quality enhancement.

## An Intelligent Car based on Raspberry Pi

In this curriculum project, we utilize Raspberry Pi 3 and some other accessories to design a simple intelligent car. The functions we have implemented include obstacle avoidance, video transmittion from Pi to PC, lane tracking, object detection, and tennis tracking.
