# Education

I'm currently an undergraduate student at the Faculty of Electronic and Information at Xi'an Jiaotong University. 

I will join the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University in 2020 fall to pursue the Ph.D. degree. My research interests will include robot localization and navigation.
