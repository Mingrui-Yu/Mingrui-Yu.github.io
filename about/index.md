## Hobbies

I love cars since I was a little boy, and that's my initial motivation to make some contribution in the field of robotics in my career.

I love playing ping-pong, badminton, and tennis. I have learned playing the guitar, but unfortunately I haven't play for about 3 years. I like singing which makes me relax, though I cannot do very well.

My ideal in life is to enjoy my life, whatever happens.
