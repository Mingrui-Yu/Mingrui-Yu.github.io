As the graduation ceremony of students in Xi'an Jiaotong University was successfully held at July 1st 2020, I have to say goodbye to this place I love. Since entering this top-tier university in China in August 2016, I have spent a full and memorable four years of undergraduate life, in which I fortunately made acquaintance with many great professors and schoolmates.

I studied in Qian Xuesen College, which is an Honors Engneering Program in XJTU. I received the Bachelor of Engineering in Automation and was rated as outstanding graduate. Different from the automation in some other universities in China, what I have majored in is to some extent more similiar to computer science and artificial intelligence.

I was also conferred the title "Honorary graduate of Qian Xuesen College", and spoke on the honorary graduation ceremony as a student representative.

After graduation, I will join the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University to pursue the Ph.D. degree in robotics, under the supervision of Prof. Xiang Li. Wish myself can enjoy life and overcome the frustrations during the research.
